# Drndic-CAD
This repository holds the CAD files I've made for various machining and 3d-printing projects in the Drndic lab.

1) Cuvette holder: This part was designed and 3d printed for our electrochemical exfoliation of VSe2 setup. Connecting the wires to the cuvette caused it to tip over, so I designed this to prevent that while still allowing us to observe the reaction.
