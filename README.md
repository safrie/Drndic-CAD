# Drndic-CAD
This repository holds the CAD files I've made for various machining and 3d-printing projects in the Drndic lab.

Cuvette holder: This part was designed and 3d printed for our electrochemical exfoliation of VSe2 setup. Connecting the wires to the cuvette caused it to tip over, so I designed this to prevent that while still allowing us to observe the reaction.

Lithography: Optial lithography designs I made for 4" wafer masks for depositing metal leads or for backside KOH etches to produce LPCVD silicon nitride TEM windows.

TEM_Stage: This is a sample carrier designed to hold the 2mm x 4mm chips (20-lead chips) on a typical JEOL TEM arm when they are not being used for in-situ TEM device measurements using the Hummingbird 8-lead transport holder. "Sample_tab" is the chip carrier itself, which was machined from brass, and the "sample_tee" was machined from copper and is screwed in place over the sample to hold it in place.
