# Drndic-CAD
This repository holds the CAD files I've made for various machining and 3d-printing projects in the Drndic lab.

Cuvette holder: This part was designed and 3d printed for our electrochemical exfoliation of VSe2 setup. Connecting the wires to the cuvette caused it to tip over, so I designed this to prevent that while still allowing us to observe the reaction.

Lithography: Optial lithography designs I made for 4" wafer masks for depositing metal leads or for backside KOH etches to produce LPCVD silicon nitride TEM windows.

TEM_Stage: This is a sample carrier designed to hold the 2mm x 4mm chips (20-lead chips) on a typical JEOL TEM arm when they are not being used for in-situ TEM device measurements using the Hummingbird 8-lead transport holder. "Sample_tab" is the chip carrier itself, which was machined from brass, and the "sample_tee" was machined from copper and is screwed in place over the sample to hold it in place.

Transfer_Station: These parts replaced the original 3d printed parts for the Drndic lab 2d material transfer station. Micromanipulator_stage is a base/adapter that attaches to a Thorlabs lab jack and has screw holes positioned such that the lab's micromanipulator can then attach to it. Microscope_transfer_stage is a platform that screws to the front of the micromanipulator for the transfer arm (the bar that holds the stamp for lifting and transferring the 2d material) to rest upon. The transfer arm can be secured either with the 1/4" bolt holes or a binder clip.

Probe_Station_Breakout: The breakout box for the probe station. Connections to the measurement station are triaxial bulkheads (left) and BNC bulkheads (right), and connections to the measurement instruments are binding posts. Three-way switches in the center allow the probe station probes to connect to a ground plane optionally shared with an instrument ground, float, or connect to their associated binding posts. Similarly, the triaxial sheaths can be switched between ground, floating, and instrument LO/guard.
